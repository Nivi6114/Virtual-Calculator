# VIRTUAL CALCULATOR


I developed a virtual calculator for this project. After execution, the code uses a webcam to capture a video and display it, along with a virtual calculator shown on the output video. The user must raise his hand in order to virtually click on the calculator with his thumb and index finger, allowing him to do any operation he desires. The outcome will be shown on the calculator's top display board.
